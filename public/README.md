# Public CV Folder

This folder is for storing your CV files that can be publicly accessed.

## Usage

Place your CV files (PDF, DOCX, HTML) in this folder. In Next.js, files in the `public` folder are served at the root path.

For example:
- `public/cv.pdf` → accessible at `/cv.pdf`
- `public/resume.pdf` → accessible at `/resume.pdf`

## Recommended Files

- `cv.pdf` - Your main CV in PDF format
- `resume.pdf` - Alternative resume version
- `cover-letter.pdf` - Cover letter template

## Note

Files in this folder will be publicly accessible when your application is deployed.
